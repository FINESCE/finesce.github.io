		<p>Smart Energy Grids have been subjects to extensive research during the last few years. The rapid development of highly effective communication technologies, in combination with the ever increasing computation capacity of contemporary data centres have assisted towards the design of such Grids. However, not all technical barriers have been eradicated, rendering their implementation, in many cases, impractical. Furthermore, most of the times Energy Utilities rely on proprietary software to power their Smart Energy Systems, limiting their sustainability flexibility as value added services are hard to implement. In the same context, third parties are very difficult to integrate into the existing systems, increasing implementation costs and contributing to vendor lock-ins.</p>
        <p>FINESCE, as a part of its value proposition to the European Energy sector and the FI-PPP Phase III projects, provides a unified, homogeneous Application Programming Interface (API) in an attempt to strictly define a common format of interaction among distinct Smart Energy Systems and facilitate access of third parties to the functionality of its seven trials. The FINESCE API has been built upon the functional requirements and characteristics of these trials, spanning numerous application domains ranging from Electric Vehicles monitoring, to Smart Factories and Energy Marketplaces. A detailed but not exhaustive list of supported categories is provided in the following paragraphs.</p>
        <p>The FINESCE API specification (currently ongoing work) is being integrated into a dedicated mediation service, provided in the form of an open-source Domain Specific Enabler (DSE), namely the FINESCE API Mediator DSE. The DSE has already been instantiated and can be graphically accessed through a dedicated web portal hosted in <a href="http://docs.fam.apiary.io" target="_blank">http://docs.fam.apiary.io</a>. With the help of the FINESCE API and the aforementioned DSE, all interested parties are able to securely access the FINESCE trial infrastructures and experiment with the FINESCE API and the historical data gathered by the FINESCE partners for more than a year.</p>
        <p>FINESCE, as a solution provider, exhibits the capabilities of Future Internet in a multitude of disciplines including, among others, low-latency Smart Grid, Smart Buildings, Electric Vehicles and Smart Factories monitoring. The functionality provided by the API as a whole is classified into 18 distinct categories, each one grouping services related to a single domain/functionality. Next, the API categories supported by the current FINESCE API specification are tabulated. Please, note that the API specification is under active development, so changes in the API definitions may occur.</p>
