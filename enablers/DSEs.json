            "Description": "\n<p>\n The need to integrate renewable power sources into the electricity \ngrid is a global imperative. Today, balance can only be maintained by \nrapidly altering conventional power outputs to compensate for changes in\n renewables. In addition where wind power is excessive, it may have to \nbe constrained, which is wasteful and incurs significant operator costs.\n Given existing emission commitments, both of these issues will only \nbecome more acute over the next two decades. A radical solution to this \ndilemma, and one that will also support long term renewable targets, is \nto invert the normal approach and to make relatively static demand level\n more dynamic and track the supply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n There are a number of important aspects to this including: regional \npower balancing, balancing of renewal supply, responding to electricity \nmarket signals, and supply-demand balancing services supplied directly \nto power system operators.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Regarding regional power balancing, the overall objective is to \nmanage EV charging processes in a region or amongst a group of \nfacilities to achieve a requested target power profile subject to \ndistribution network constraints. Such constraints must be monitored by \nthe DSO and respected by the charging optimisation system.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The COS DSE ensures that the large-scale coordinated interruption \nand de-interruption of electric vehicle charging will not disrupt the \nlocal distribution network.\n</p>\n\n<a name=\"Basic-Concepts\">\n</a>\n\n<h3>\n Basic Concepts\n <a class=\"wiki-anchor\" href=\"#Basic-Concepts\">\n  \u00b6\n </a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n The functional model presented in this section aims to encompass the\n whole of the charging optimisation space, as well as related functions \nsuch as for example TSO/DSO power system management, renewable \ngeneration (eg. wind farms and solar power plants) management, and \nenergy market management functions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The trial will focus only on those parts of the charging \noptimisation function that are interesting and realistic to implement, \nare relevant for Generic Enabler application, and will yield valuable \nresult when scaled to the commercial level.\n</p>\n\n<a name=\"Basic-Design-Principles\">\n</a>\n\n<h3>\n Basic Design Principles\n <a class=\"wiki-anchor\" href=\"#Basic-Design-Principles\">\n  \u00b6\n </a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"COS_files/wp5_cos_dse.png\" style=\"width: 75%;\"/>\n</p>\n\n<table>\n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"background:lightgrey;\">\n    Sub-function\n   </td>\n   <td style=\"background:lightgrey;\">\n    Description\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n    Grid Emergency Processing\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    This is a new component to the COS DSE.
