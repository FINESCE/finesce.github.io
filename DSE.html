												<h2>i. Preface</h2>
												<p>The FITMAN 3DScan Specific Enabler is a component
													that assures the possibility of storing and visualizing
													precise scanned images obtained from real objects. This
													system can be used in many fields. The Specific Enabler
													provides, in this sense, a fast way of obtaining very
													accurate surface representations, the possibility to store
													them (together with other relevant data) and to visualize
													them in a clear and intuitive way. Both modules (Storage
													and Visualization) are conceived to be used together,
													although they can also be used independently.</p>
												<p>One of the main challenges that manufacturing is
													facing nowadays is the need to achieve a high quality
													production (in some industries the objective has been set
													in the so called 0% defect) without slowing down the
													production processes, which are also been fastened to
													respond to the stressful delivery requirements.The solution
													to this problem is obviously to approach the control to the
													100% of the production, to assure that no pieces with
													defects are sent to the customer. The Specific Enabler
													provides, in this sense, provides a fast way of performing
													quality controls and an intuitive visualization decision
													support system to determine if the analysed manufactured
													part must be accepted or rejected.</p>

												<h2>iii. Overview</h2>
												<p>In the case of dimensional control, a suitable option
													is related to visualization and/or colour mapping
													technologies. These technologies need a previous scan of
													the analysed piece to compare it with the design CAD
													figure. From this comparison a colour map to support the
													decision of acceptance/rejection supported by the
													visualization component of the Specific Enabler. Moreover,
													generating reports where the piece is analysed in detail
													and compared with the design and the tolerances previously
													defined is also possible. This process needs to store a
													great quantity of data (clouds of points, raw data, and
													metadata of the analysed part, tolerances and/or the
													process) that can be very heavy files. This constraint must
													also be accomplished to allow the quality control process
													to be fast enough. In this case the option could be a Big
													Data storage system with Hadoop technology besides the
													relational database. (storage component of the Specific
													Enabler).</p>
												<p>The solution provided by Datapixel consists of a
													3Dscanning sensor, the Specific Enabler (3DScan) that will
													be presented in this section and the Trial Specific
													Component (3D Point Cloud Analysis Processing) detailed in
													the fllowing diagram. When scanning a real part the output
													acquired, as said before, is a point cloud that can be
													defined as a surface representation constituting of
													individual points obtained from a scanning system .</p>
												<p>
													The operation workflow of 3DScan component as whole is
													detailed below. Each point corresponds to step of the
													scanning system process:<br />

												</center>
												<br />
												<center>Figure 1: Control Quality workflow using
													3DScan</center>
												<ol>
													<li>The analysed part is scanned with a 3D Scanner.
														After scanning the piece a set of individual points
														belonging to the surface of the physical piece is
														obtained. This is known as the cloud of points.</li>
													<li>The information previously acquired is processed
														by the system algorithm. In this stage some operations are
														done to find in the obtained cloud of points some
														requested geometries. This is done with the help of some
														libraries and it is known as geometry extraction.</li>
													<li>The point cloud obtained and the geometries
														extracted are compared to the 3D CAD design of the
														analysed part (real part vs ideal part). In the analysis
														phase the comparison is made, calculating the results,
														including the tolerances defined for the piece that
														separate the rejection/acceptation regions.</li>
													<li>The results of the analysis are shown in the
														Visualizer component. There are many options to present
														the results. One of the most common options consists in a
														colour mapping that presents the studied part in a colour
														representation with the differences between the real
														dimensions and the envisaged dimensions. This way of
														representing if the piece accomplishes with the tolerances
														allows validating the piece with a quick view.</li>
													<li>In all the steps of the workflow data is being
														regularly recorded in the Big Data storage system. In the
														storage component the following data is saved: metadata
														belonging to the analysed part, to its manufacturing
														process, to the tolerances accepted, as well as the cloud
														of points obtained after the scanning of the part, the
														data processed after the geometry extraction and the
														results and its graphical representation. Lots of
														operations can be done with the stored data, as for
														example calculating trends, statistical information and
														other indicators related with historical information.</li>
												</ol>
												<p>Considering this application in quality control of
													the manufacturing domain, the Specific Enabler is oriented
													to the following interest groups:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Manufacturing Quality Engineers can use the
														Specific Enabler to control the production quality.</li>
													<li>Manufacturing Production Engineers can use the
														Specific Enabler to have a notion of the quality of the
														manufacturing process and can later improve it.</li>
													<li>Design Engineers can use the Specific Enabler as a
														test between the production reality and their designs, and
														it may be useful for them to adjust tolerances.</li>
												</ul>
												<h2>iv. Detailed Architecture and Specification</h2>
												<h3>3DScan is organised according to the following
													architecture:</h3>
												<p></p>
												<center>
													<img
														src="/sites/default/files/enabler-atttachments/3dScanArchitecture 1.png " />
												</center>
												<br />
												<center>Figure 2:Architecture of the high level
													architecture</center>
												<ol>
													<li>Gage: Provides to 3DScan every related tool to
														allow the best machine performance and efficiency (sensor
														qualification, positioning correction…). This part of the
														system handles the acquisition of data.</li>
													<li>Server: Manages the digital parts and the clouds
														of points. Stores information in a superior layer to be
														shared among all elements within a network in a flexible
														way.</li>
													<li>Middleware: This layer includes compression
														technologies, content markup, access control, messaging
														and events.</li>
													<li>Server (analytics): This part includes 3D
														computational technologies for the point clouds analysis
														and Big Data technologies for the analysis of the
														production based on the analysis of lots of 3D point
														clouds.</li>
													<li>Visualizer: This component of the SE allows the
														user to see the results of the quality control represented
														graphically. It aims to present a great quantity of
														information in an intuitive way so the user can decide
														quickly about the analysed part.</li>
													<li>Work station: Provides to the user with the
														necessary commands to operate 3DScan component.</li>
													<li>Storage: Allows to store all the data acquired
														(raw data), as well as the new data generated by the
														system itself: clouds of points, processed data, analysis
														and results, and the graphical representation of these
														results). It also stores the metadata of the analysed part
														and the manufacturing process.</li>
												</ol>
												<h3>RESTful API Specification:</h3>
												<p>
													The Resful services includes: Upload new 3D file, Update
													the exsited 3Dfilem, Delete file, View the 3D file in the
													format of cloud point or mesh.<br /> Before verifying the
													REST API of these functionalities, we suggest installing
													the REST API client in Chrome or Firefox web browser.<br />
													In the example below, tests are running in the POSTMAN
													plugin of Chrome.
												</p>
												<ul type="i">
													<li>Send POST with the 3D file to upload a new file :</li>
													<p>
														<i>http://{server Ip: port}/{your application
															root}/post/upload/?Content-Type=application/xml&amp;charset=utf-8&amp;Content-Length=150</i><br />
														The place for storing the image file could be configured
														in the <i>config.properties </i> which will be explained
														in detail in the following confiuration part.
													</p>
													<li>Send POST with new 3D file to update exsited file
														stored:</li>
													<p>
														<i>http://{server Ip: port}/{your application
															root}/post/update/{object id}</i>
													</p>
													<li>Send DELETE to delete the existed 3D file:</li>
													<p>
														<i>http://{server Ip: port}/{your application
															root}/delete/{object id}</i>
													</p>
													<li>View one existed 3D file stored:</li>
													<p>
														<i>http://{server Ip: port}/{your application
															root}/get/id_canvas/1</i><br /> The return data is a
														javascript code which could be integrated in any web page
														to display the 3D file detailed in the next section.
													</p>
												</ul>
												<h2>v. Interactions and Interfaces</h2>
												<h3>Local Deployment Configuration</h3>
												<p>
													The 3Dscan SE runs in a servlet container such as Tomcat,
													thus it does not depend on a particular operating system
													flavor.<br /> Installation Steps:
												</p>
												<ol>
													<li>Install Java version 6 or 7 if there is no Java
														configured in the PC.</li>
													<li>Install Apache Tomcat servlet container version 6.</li>
													<li>Get the FITMAN3Dscan.zip file and extract it. It
														contains 2 application files: sqlrest folder and
														fitmanGL.war. And it also includes the script for creating
														the database in MySQL server of managing the file storage
														path.</li>
													<li>Install MySQL server 5.5 and create the database
														called FITMAN with the script provided in the Zip file.
														Meanwhile to ensure there is
														mysql-connector-java-5.1.31-bin.jar in the bin folder of
														Tomcat in order to connect to MySQL, if not copy the jar
														file from the extracted Zip file.</li>
													<li>Copy the sqlrest folder and the .war file of SE to
														the {TomcatRoot}/webapps directory.</li>
													<li>Then configure the sqlrestconfig.xml in the
														extracted sqlrest directory with your own MySQL database
														username and password as the following xml file:</li>

													<li>Starting virtual machines:</li>
													<p>
														The 3Dscan VM instance is running CentOS(minimal, no GUI
														version), which could be deployed in Oracle VM VirtualBox.
														The Virtual network type is set to bridge (default with
														libvrt) or Bridge ( enables network cards ).<br /> If the
														free RAM is getting less than 1GB and there is less than
														5GB of free disk space, the GE instance begins to
														experience problems.<br /> Once the Virtual Machines are
														installed and running and their network accessible, and
														you can access to it by using command:<br /> <i>sudo
															bash<br /> Login: root<br /> Password: centos
														</i>
													</p>
													<p>
														To discover the guest virtual network IP address from the
														host in a terminal, the command can be used (as root) in
														the host:<br /> <i>ifconfig</i><br /> An example for
														eth0 (could be any number) configuration is the following:
													</p>
													<div class="geshifilter">
														<pre class="text geshifilter-text"

													<li>Sanity checks before running SE:</li>
												</ol>
												<ul>
													<li>TOMCAT</li>
													<p>
														As default, Tomcat should be auto-start with the system,
														to check the status :<br /> <i># service tomcat
															status</i><br /> If is not running, to start it:<br /> <i>#
															service tomcat start</i><br /> To stop it:<br /> <i>#
															service tomcat stop</i>
													</p>
													<p>
														The default port for Tomcat is TCP 8080 which is opened
														for host access. The installation path of Tomcat is
														/home/apache-tomcat-7.0.53<br /> The html interface for
														Tomcat can be accessed from any browser on the host
														through the following url:<br /> <i>http://[SERVER
															PATH]:8080</i>
													</p>
													<p>
														To manage app from Tomcat Web GUI in any web browser:<br />
														<i>Username: tomcat<br /> Password: tomcat
														</i>
													</p>
													<li>MySQL</li>
													<p>
														Mysql, as per default, is auto-started, To check it
														status:<br /> <i># service mysqld status</i>
													</p>
													<p>
														To start it tun:<br /> <i># service mysqld start</i>
													</p>
													<p>
														A quick fix to set MySQL to auto-start, is to run the
														following command as root:<br /> <i># sudo
															/sbin/chkconfig --level 2345 mysqld on</i>
													</p>
													<p>Check if the MySql contains “Fitman3dImages”
														database which is required by the GE, and initialize the
														Database by executing the sql script provided with the SE
														package to create tables needed.</p>
												</ul>
												<li>How to start the SE:</li>

													Is deployed as a .war in Tomcat webapps folder.<br />
													*Assure the config.properties in <b>/webapps/Fitman3DScan/WEB-INF/classes/</b>
													is configured with the "VM server" path.<br /> To test the
													SE, see the aforementioned <b>RESTful API Specification
													</b>.

												</p>
												<h3>Interfaces</h3>
												<p>
													To confirm all the services are running properly after
													configuration, we make some interfaces to call REST API in
													oder to manage 3D files and then test the web viewer for
													displaying 3D point cloud file and mesh file.<br />
													Testing files are called <b>index.jsp </b>and <b>index_update.jsp
													</b> deployed in the Tomcat during installation by paste the
													following urls in any web browser:<br /> <i>http://{server
														Ip: port}/{your application root}/index.jsp</i><br />
