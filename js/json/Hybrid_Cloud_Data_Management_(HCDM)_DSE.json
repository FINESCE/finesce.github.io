            "Description": "\n\n<h3>\n Basic Concepts\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n Hybrid Cloud Data Management DSE is built by the combination and integration of Object Storage GE and Identity Management Keyrock GE instances in FIWARE Lab, the local deployment of Object Storage capacities and additional encryption functionalities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n It was originally designed to provide transparent access to the Hybrid Cloud infrastructure for the data management of the utilities within the \"Software Define Utility\" concept.  It offers with a single dashboard tool the storage management of data in two sides. Distributed machines are used to store private and very sensitive data, while the rest of the data is stored in FILAB Cloud. The identity management of all the users in order to access this data is undertaken using Identity Management Keyrock GE in FIWARE Lab.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Basic Design Principles\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n This DSE consist encompasses three main building blocks, and a unified API in order to interact with the storage system (HCDM API).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n First, through this API, users can authenticate using the IdM Keyrock, assuring a secure access to the system. The identity management module of the HCDM DSE also adds a local temporally authentication in order to speed up the subsequent accesses to the platform, and increasing the level of fault tolerance. The Storage Access module manages the access to the distributed storage system that is used as a Private Cloud (replicating data among other deployed machines), and a Public Cloud storage based on the FIWARE Lab, and the Object Storage GE instance deployed there. Finally, the replication policies are configured through the Storage Reasoning &amp; Policies module\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/HCDM_DSE.png\" style=\"width: 60%;\"/>\n</p>\n\n\n",

            "Details": "\n<p>\n The HCDM API which is up and available to use, allows a user to access and manage data objects in the private cloud provided in the trial-site of Ireland, which is used to store historic EVSE data, or in the public cloud deployed in the FIWARE Lab.\n <br/>\n This API would open possibilities of share DSO data with other stakeholders in an easy and secure way.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The API follows the rules of a common RESTful approach:\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n <li>\n  Rely on HTTP/RESTful services (wherever possible) in order to address the most broad community of application developers with the popular technology\n </li>\n <li>\n  Expose WP5 Stream II Future Internet in Smart Distribution Grid Communications infrastructure and trial results\n </li>\n <li>\n  Expose the HCDM DSE interface allowing the system to be accessible for external applications.\n </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<h3>\n API Control functions\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n The base url for all requests is\n <strong>\n  xxxx\n </strong>\n , and any requests using http will be redirected to https, of note a self-signed cert is used for SSL.\n</p>\n\n\n\nThe following HTTP commands have been implemented being used to manipulate the data controlled by the FINESCE system.\n\t<ol>\n <li>\n  HTTP GET commands used to retrieve information or objects from the cloud platforms.\n </li>\n <li>\n  HTTP PUT commands used to create new containers in the cloud platforms or upload a new object.\n </li>\n <li>\n  HTTP DELETE commands used to delete objects or containers stored in the cloud platforms.\n </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\n The following services are offered in the external API. All calls require an auth_token to be sent with the request (This excludes the tokens endpoint). NOTE: the parameter for sending the authorisation token is \"auth_token\".\n</p>\n\n<p>\n #List\n <br/>\n #Create (container)\n <br/>\n #Delete\n <br/>\n #Download\n <br/>\n #Upload\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Authentication process\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n In order to ensure that the user can store data in the private Cloud the authentication proxy will first validate that the user has an Object Storage application membership in IdM Keyrock. Once this validation has succeeded, then it will authenticate against Keystone. The token used for validating will be keystone\u2019s one.\n <br/>\n Different roles will be applied depending on the role on the Keyrock\u2019s application role (reseller / purchaser).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/authentication.png\" style=\"width: 60%;\"/>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n First of all, the User sends its credentials to the AuthProxy. Then, it sends the username and password to FI-LAB\u2019s Keyrock and gets the token. With this token we can ask again to FI-LAB what applications the user has. If one of them is Object Storage we will proceed requesting a token to Keystone and then determining tenancy and get the Swift token.\n <br/>\n The token will be bundled in the response so that after this process the user knows its token. When the authentication proxy knows the token, it will store it in memcache so that for future requests (while the token is valid) it will optimize the process avoiding the validation process against FI-LAB that introduces lots of latency.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/authentication_simplified.png\" style=\"width: 60%;\"/>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n In this case, the user sends the user + pass or the token and the resource that wants to access. The first thing that the Auth Server does is check cache if the user+pass hash matches the stored in cache. If this process success it directly can assure that the user was previously authenticated and it\u2019s not necessary to check the authentication again with FIWARE Lab.\n <br/>\n In case that no match was found in the Memcache server, it would proceed as shown in the previous figure.\n <br/>\n When working with local cache the performance is far more optimal. Supposing 50 ms round-trip delay per request, it would be around 250ms less working with cache.\n <br/>\n When authentication is done against FIWARE Lab, the token, user and pass map is stored in memcache server. There\u2019s also added an expiry field that comes as a response from the FIWARE Lab server. So the auth-proxy won\u2019t authenticate tokens that are expired. In case of an expired token, the server would return a HTTP_TIMEOUT or HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED so that the client knows that the token has expired and requests a new one.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Local instance environment deployment\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n In order to deploy a local instance of the DSE, it is needed to deploy at least one node of the distributed storage system. A guide of how to deploy new nodes and how to interconnect them is given in the following document\n <a class=\"attachment\" href=\"files/Distributed_Storage_New_Node_Deployment.doc\">\n  Distributed_Storage_New_Node_Deployment.doc\n </a>\n .\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n HCDM DSE front-end application\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n In order to interact with the DSE, a java-based front-end application is also offered. It uses the HCDM API in order to provide remote visual management of the private and public clod repositories. Ir provides three basic windows. First, a login window will allow the user to identify itself, starting the authentication process against the Identity Management Keyrock of the FIWARE Lab. Preferences window allows users to select the endpoint of the local and remote Object Storage proxy node and enabling SSL functionalities. Finally, the main File Manager window will allow users to create private or public (in FIWARE Lab) new folders, delete them, upload or download objects from both sites, migrate them from private to public storage and viceversa, or delete objects.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/Front-end_HCDM_login.png\" style=\"width: 40%;\"/>\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/Front-end_HCDM_settings.png\" style=\"width: 40%;\"/>\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/Front-end_HCDM_manager.png\" style=\"width: 40%;\"/>\n</p>\n\n\n",
