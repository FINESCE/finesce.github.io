It offers with a single dashboard tool the storage management of data in two sides. Distributed machines are used to store private and very sensitive data, while the rest of the data is stored in FILAB Cloud. The identity management of all the users in order to access this data is undertaken using Identity Management Keyrock GE in FIWARE Lab.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Basic Design Principles\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n This DSE consist encompasses three main building blocks, and a unified API in order to interact with the storage system (HCDM API).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n First, through this API, users can authenticate using the IdM Keyrock, assuring a secure access to the system. The identity management module of the HCDM DSE also adds a local temporally authentication in order to speed up the subsequent accesses to the platform, and increasing the level of fault tolerance.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The Storage Access module is the one that links\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/HCDM_DSE.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"/>\n</p>\n\n\n",
