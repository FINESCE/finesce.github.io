It offers with a single dashboard tool the storage management of data in two sides. Distributed machines are used to store private and very sensitive data, while the rest of the data is stored in FILAB Cloud. The identity management of all the users in order to access this data is undertaken using Identity Management Keyrock GE in FIWARE Lab.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Basic Design Principles\n</h3>\n\n\n",
