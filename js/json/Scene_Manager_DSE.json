            "Description": "\n\n<h3>\n Basic Concepts\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n This DSE works together with the Publish/Subscribe Context Broker \u2013 Context Awareness Platform in order to perform the event configuration, receive alert notifications, and manage the subscriptions to those events. A prototype web application has been developed for accessing the functionalities of the DSE. The figure below provides a screenshot of this web application, with the tab corresponding to the Scene Manager DSE.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/SceneManagerDSE.png\"/>\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Basic Design Principles\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n A programmed task in Java is in charge of creating the scenes in the Publish/Subscribe Context Broker - Context Awareness Platform, because this module cannot read directly from the internal databases of the trial. Additionally, another programmed task is in charge of maintaining all the subscriptions active, because their period of expiration is too limited for the application requirements (less than 1 day). This is the reason why this Java task is being executed continuously \u2013 otherwise the subscriptions would be lost due to the restrictions of the Context Awareness Platform. Thus, the programmed task ensures that all alerts are triggered and sent when the scene parameters are within the configured ranges.\n</p>\n\n\n",

        "Overview": "\n<p>\n The purpose of the Scene Manager DSE is to allow the configuration of a set of multiple parameters (scene) from the different Madrid trial subsystems, based on which different alerts can be triggered and offered to subscribed users.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n What you get\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n With the Scene Manager DSE it is possible to access a set of configurable parameters from the Madrid trial, and to create customized scenes based on them. Currently the accessible parameters are associated to the following subsystems:\n <br/>\n - Smart metering infrastructure, based on wireless sensor technology\n <br/>\n - Weather forecasting system, based on an Internet web service\n <br/>\n The parameters from the following subsytems will be made accessible as well:\n <br/>\n - Building Control Centre, a tool which allows remote connection to the Building Management System (BMS)\n <br/>\n - Micro-grid, which includes PV solar panels, simulated wind power, a battery, and a load with configurable profile.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Why to get it\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n This DSE provides to FIWARE adopters guidance on how to establish an alert management system based on multiple conditions set by the end users of the application. It is based on the Publish/Subscribe Context Broker - Context Awareness Platform, but it could be modified to use Orion Context Broker GE instead.\n</p>\n\n\n",
