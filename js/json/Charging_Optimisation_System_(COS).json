            "Description": "\n<p>\n The need to integrate renewable power sources into the electricity grid is a global imperative. Today, balance can only be maintained by rapidly altering conventional power outputs to compensate for changes in renewables. In addition where wind power is excessive, it may have to be constrained, which is wasteful and incurs significant operator costs. Given existing emission commitments, both of these issues will only become more acute over the next two decades. A radical solution to this dilemma, and one that will also support long term renewable targets, is to invert the normal approach and to make relatively static demand level more dynamic and track the supply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n There are a number of important aspects to this including: regional power balancing, balancing of renewal supply, responding to electricity market signals, and supply-demand balancing services supplied directly to power system operators.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Regarding regional power balancing, the overall objective is to manage EV charging processes in a region or amongst a group of facilities to achieve a requested target power profile subject to distribution network constraints. Such constraints must be monitored by the DSO and respected by the charging optimisation system.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The COS ensures that the large-scale coordinated interruption and de-interruption of electric vehicle charging will not disrupt the local distribution network.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Basic Concepts\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n The functional model presented in this section aims to encompass the whole of the charging optimisation space, as well as related functions such as for example TSO/DSO power system management, renewable generation (eg. wind farms and solar power plants) management, and energy market management functions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The trial will focus only on those parts of the charging optimisation function that are interesting and realistic to implement, are relevant for Generic Enabler application, and will yield valuable result when scaled to the commercial level.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Basic Design Principles\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/wp5_cos_dse.png\" style=\"width: 75%;\" class=img-responsive />\n</p>\n\n<table class=\"themed\">\n <tr class=\"top\">\n  <td style=\"background:lightgrey;\">\n   Sub-function\n  </td>\n  <td style=\"background:lightgrey;\">\n   Description\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n   Grid Emergency Processing\n  </td>\n  <td>\n   This is a new component to the COS.

Servo will investigate the distribution network impact of such a change, and respond to the charging interruption management component with either a go or no go response. If Servo denies a change, the charging interruption management system will inform the Optimisation System with the response from Servo. Alternatively if Servo responds favourably, the charging interruption management component will enact the optimisation request by forwarding the particular changes for each individual EVSE to the Conflict Resolver.\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n   FI-WARE Data handling GE\n  </td>\n  <td>\n   The Data handling GE is used to ensure the privacy of sensitive data.

Further, if you want to terminate the Terms, you must provide FINESCE with prior written notice and upon termination, cease your use of the applicable APIs. FINESCE reserves the right to terminate the Terms with you or discontinue the APIs or any portion or feature or your access thereto for any reason and at any time without liability or other obligation to you.\n</p>\n\n\n<h4>\n Your Obligations Post-Termination\n</h4>\n\n<p>\n Upon any termination of the Terms or discontinuation of your access to an API, you will immediately stop using the API, cease all use of the FINESCE, and delete any cached or stored content that was permitted by the cache header. FINESCE may independently communicate with any account owner whose account(s) are associated with your API Client and developer credentials to provide notice of the termination of your right to use an API.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Liability for our APIs\n</h3>\n\n\n<h4>\n WARRANTIES\n</h4>\n\n<p>\n EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THE TERMS, NEITHER FINESCE NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE APIS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON'T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT ACCESSED THROUGH THE APIS, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE APIS, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE APIS \"AS IS\".\n</p>\n\n<p>\n SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN THE TERMS, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND UNDERTAKINGS.\n</p>\n\n\n<h4>\n LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n</h4>\n\n<p>\n WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, FINESCE, AND FINESCE'S SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA; FINANCIAL LOSSES; OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF FINESCE, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM UNDER THE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID EURO TO USE THE APPLICABLE APIS (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE APIS AGAIN) DURING THE SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n IN ALL CASES, FINESCE, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY EXPENSE, LOSS, OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.\n</p>\n\n\n<h4>\n Indemnification\n</h4>\n\n<p>\n Unless prohibited by applicable law, if you are a business, you will defend and indemnify FINESCE, and its affiliates, researchers, and users, against all liabilities, damages, losses, costs, fees (including legal fees), and expenses relating to any allegation or third-party legal proceeding to the extent arising from:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  your misuse or your end user's misuse of the APIs;\n </li>\n <li>\n  your violation or your end user's violation of the Terms; or\n </li>\n <li>\n  any content or data routed into or used with the APIs by you, those acting on your behalf, or your end users.\n </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3>\n General Provisions\n</h3>\n\n\n<h4>\n Modification\n</h4>\n\n<p>\n We may modify the Terms or any portion to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our APIs. You should look at the Terms regularly. We'll post notice of modifications to the Terms within the documentation of each applicable API, to this website, and/or on the FINESCE website. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than 30 days after they are posted. But changes addressing new functions for an API or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified Terms for an API, you should discontinue your use of that API. Your continued use of the API constitutes your acceptance of the modified Terms.\n</p>\n\n\n<h4>\n General Legal Terms\n</h4>\n\n<p>\n We each agree to contract in the English language. If we provide a translation of the Terms, we do so for your convenience only and the English Terms will solely govern our relationship. The Terms do not create any third party beneficiary rights or any agency, partnership, or joint venture. Nothing in the Terms will limit either party's ability to seek injunctive relief. We are not liable for failure or delay in performance to the extent caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control. If you do not comply with the Terms, and FINESCE does not take action right away, this does not mean that FINESCE is giving up any rights that it may have (such as taking action in the future). If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. The Terms are the entire agreement between you and FINESCE relating to its subject and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements on that subject.
