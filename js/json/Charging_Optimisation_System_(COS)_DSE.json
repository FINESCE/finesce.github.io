            "Description": "\n<p>\n The need to integrate renewable power sources into the electricity grid is a global imperative. Today, balance can only be maintained by rapidly altering conventional power outputs to compensate for changes in renewables. In addition where wind power is excessive, it may have to be constrained, which is wasteful and incurs significant operator costs. Given existing emission commitments, both of these issues will only become more acute over the next two decades. A radical solution to this dilemma, and one that will also support long term renewable targets, is to invert the normal approach and to make relatively static demand level more dynamic and track the supply.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n There are a number of important aspects to this including: regional power balancing, balancing of renewal supply, responding to electricity market signals, and supply-demand balancing services supplied directly to power system operators.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Regarding regional power balancing, the overall objective is to manage EV charging processes in a region or amongst a group of facilities to achieve a requested target power profile subject to distribution network constraints. Such constraints must be monitored by the DSO and respected by the charging optimisation system.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The COS DSE ensures that the large-scale coordinated interruption and de-interruption of electric vehicle charging will not disrupt the local distribution network.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Basic Concepts\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n The functional model presented in this section aims to encompass the whole of the charging optimisation space, as well as related functions such as for example TSO/DSO power system management, renewable generation (eg. wind farms and solar power plants) management, and energy market management functions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The trial will focus only on those parts of the charging optimisation function that are interesting and realistic to implement, are relevant for Generic Enabler application, and will yield valuable result when scaled to the commercial level.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Basic Design Principles\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/wp5_cos_dse.png\" style=\"width: 75%;\"/>\n</p>\n\n<table class=\"themed\">\n <tr class=\"top\">\n  <td style=\"background:lightgrey;\">\n   Sub-function\n  </td>\n  <td style=\"background:lightgrey;\">\n   Description\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n   Grid Emergency Processing\n  </td>\n  <td>\n   This is a new component to the COS DSE. The Grid Emergency Processing component listens for Grid Emergency events being transmitted by the Grid Emergency Initiator (DSO/TSO). Requests are first decrypted using the Content Based Security generic enabler, before being validated. When such a message has been validated as authentic, the Grid Emergency Processing component will initiate a grid emergency within the charge optimisation system by requesting all EVSEs cease charging immediately.\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n   EVSE Controller\n  </td>\n  <td>\n   This component connects to an individual EVSE in order to control it, and also will be used retrieve the data blocks of information being transmitted by the EVSE.\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n   EVSE Data Parser\n  </td>\n  <td>\n   This component retrieves raw data from the message queue on the message bus, will parse the data and pass to the Data Validator for validation and integrity check.\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n   EVSE Data Validator\n  </td>\n  <td>\n   The contents of the parsed data block (from EVSE Data Parser) are validated against the checksum attached to the data block by this component.\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n   Data Processing and Analytics Engine\n  </td>\n  <td>\n   The charge optimisation system makes use of a distributed computation platform, Apache Storm along with the Complex Event Processing generic enabler in order to process the massive and continuous stream of data entering the system from the trial EVSEs.

It is possible to retrieve, analyse and graph charge profiles for individual EVSEs, or access current and historic regional renewables supply data, along with forecasted demand. e.g. The Optimisation Service is itself an application built using this Web Application API, as is the administration dashboard application.\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n   Conflict Resolver\n  </td>\n  <td>\n   The responsibilities of the Conflict Resolver is that of EVSE communication exception handling within the COS. e.g. When a charge optimisation request is issued, the conflict resolver will ensure that requests will not be sent to an EVSE if it does not currently have a car connected.\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n   Regional Power Optimizer\n  </td>\n  <td>\n   Optimises a schedule for a given number of controllable loads to follow a given (aggregated) power profile with a given forecast duration.\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n   Charging Interruption Management\n  </td>\n  <td>\n   This is a new component to the COS DSE. The charging interruption management component is responsible for handling the conversion of charge optimisation requests into charging change authorisation requests for the ESB Servo system. Servo will investigate the distribution network impact of such a change, and respond to the charging interruption management component with either a go or no go response. If Servo denies a change, the charging interruption management system will inform the Optimisation System with the response from Servo. Alternatively if Servo responds favourably, the charging interruption management component will enact the optimisation request by forwarding the particular changes for each individual EVSE to the Conflict Resolver.\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n   FI-WARE Data handling GE\n  </td>\n  <td>\n   The Data handling GE is used to ensure the privacy of sensitive data. In the case of the Charging Optimisation System the sensitive data in question relates to data belonging to the EVSE. This GE uses a Sticky Policy which is written in Privacy Policy Language. The policy provides control over a) who can access this data and b) the duration for which this data can be accessed.\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n   FI-WARE DB Anonymiser GE\n  </td>\n  <td>\n   This GE is currently being integrated with the COS DSE system to evaluate the adequateness (in maintaining privacy and anonymisation) of a disclosure policy to be used to disclose a dataset from the COS DSE to third parties such as SMEs.

The GE implements security standards such as OAuth and OpenId. The GE has been selected to provide authentication to clients who require to access data in the COS DSE system. The Identity Management GCP GE is used in the Charging Optimisation System as a means for authenticating its Web API users. As the API provides access to data stored within the COS, security is a major factor and as such it is of upmost importance that persons allowed to access this data can be verified in a controlled and reliable manner.\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n   FI-WARE Content Based Security GE\n  </td>\n  <td>\n   This GE is integrated locally and is being used by the developers of the COS DSE system in order to support the confidentiality of grid emergency messages between TSOs/DSOs and the COS DSE. A second instance of the content based security will be required to be hosted on the TSO/DSO side of the connection in a grid initiator application which generates the initial grid emergency messages.\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n   FI-WARE Complex Event Processing GE\n  </td>\n  <td>\n   The CEP GE analyses event data in real-time, generates immediate insight and enables instant response to changing conditions. While standard reactive applications are based on reactions to single events, the CEP GE reacts to situations rather than to single events. A situation is a condition that is based on a series of events that have occurred within a dynamic time window called processing context. Situations include composite events (e.g., sequence), counting operators on events (e.g., aggregation) and absence operators.. Due to the data protection requirements for the COS DSE it is considered necessary to integrate a localised instance of the Complex Event Processing GE which will work alongside and compliment the Apache Storm stream processor of the COS DSE\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td>\n   FI-WARE Cloud Edge GE\n  </td>\n  <td>\n   This GE is deployed as a network bridging application in order to connect an electric vehicle charge equipment to the COS DSE.\n  </td>\n </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n",
