These context events (ORION \u201centities\u201d) are updated with a certain frequency thus representing data flowing into the energy marketplace from the outside \u201creal world\u201d.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n GE Dependancies\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n The implementation of this DSE is working with an instance of ORION v0.14.\n</p>\n\n\n",

        "Usage": "\n\n<h3>\n Installation guide\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n IMPORTANT: we kindly remind you that this software module is strictly tight to the use of ORION Context Broker GE thus meaning that you should have previously set up an ORION instance of yours. Please have a look at ORION GE documentation at the following link\n <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://catalogue.fi-ware.org/enablers/publishsubscribe-context-broker-orion-context-broker\">\n  publishsubscribe-context-broker-orion-context-broker\n </a>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Download the artefact (in the form a .war file) from the download section.\n <br/>\n Open the .war file (you can use an appropriate software like \u201cwinRar\u201d), open the  \u201csocial2orion.properties\u201d file located in the following directory:  WEB-INF/classes/ and then amend the following configuration properties:\n</p>\n\n<pre>\nsocial2orion.orionServerUrl = http://(your ORION instance URL):1026\nsocial2orion.registerContexPath = NGSI10/updateContext\n</pre>\n\n<p>\n Save the changes to the .properties file and deploy the .war file on a Tomcat application server using the \u201cTomcat Web Application Manager\u201d (see attached screenshot). We recommend you to use an updated version of Tomcat; we have used Apache Tomcat 7.xx.\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/Social2Orion_TomcatManager_screenshot.png\" style=\"width:1000px;\" class=img-responsive />\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Figure 3: How to the deploy the social2orion .war file\n </strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n To verify that the deploy of the social2orion application was done successfully  and that it consequently runs, you have to type the following URL in a common browser like Google Chrome or Microsoft Internet Explorer:\n</p>\n\n<pre>\nhttp://(your tomcat ip)/social2orion/rest/sendSocialData\n</pre>\n\n<p>\n and you should get a page like the following (see attached screenshot).\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/browser_test_Social2Orion_GET.png\" class=img-responsive />\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Figure 4: Test \"sendSocialData\" GET method in a browser\n </strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n If the previous page appears, the social2orion application is correctly deployed.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Usage guide\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n Now, in order to send a \u201cSocial Event\u201d to ORION, use a REST client such as DHC - REST/HTTP API Client chrome extension (see attached screenshot):\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/chrome_REST_client_screenshot.png\" style=\"width:1000px;\" class=img-responsive />\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Figure 5: Send a \"Social Event\" to ORION\n </strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Please fill in with the following parametres:\n <br/>\n SERVICE (POST)\n <br/>\n</p>\n<pre>\nhttp://(your tomcat ip)/social2orion/rest/sendSocialData\n</pre>\n\n<p>\n HEADERS\n <br/>\n</p>\n<pre>\nContent-Type: application/xml\n</pre>\n\n<p>\n BODY\n <br/>\n</p>\n<pre>\n&lt;social socialEventTypology=\" _(social event name)_ \" \nsocialEventDateTime=\" _(social

HTTP Response, you should have submitted a \u201csocial event\u201d to ORION.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n To verify that a new \u201csocial event\u201d has been saved into ORION, an entity of the following type should be created (or updated in case it already exists) in the NoSQL DB underlying ORION (i.e. MongoDB):\n <br/>\n</p>\n<pre>\n{\n  \"_id\" : {\n    \"id\" : \"social2orion\",\n    \"type\" :
