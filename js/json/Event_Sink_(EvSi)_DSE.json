            "Description": "\n<p>\n The EvSi DSE interfaces to a locally installed Orion Publish/ Subscribe Context Broker used to aggregate local events and forward them to the cloud. Whereas it is desirable to use all events and information online (i.e. on FIWARE LAB), a lot of companies still rather prefer to store their sensitive data offline on their own servers. EvSi DSE allows for a simple way to store all information locally, only using established Open Source-software.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Note: With version 2.0 of the EvSi DSE the codebase has been moved from originally C#.NET and MS SQL to Node.JS and MongoDB. This change with accompanied by exchaning the Gateway Data Handling GE on the factory shopfloor with an on-premise Orion Context Broker. The legacy code can be found on\n <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/FINESCE/OBDC-Event-Sink-EvSi-DSE\">\n  GitHub\n </a>\n .\n</p>\n\n\n",

            "Details": "\n<p>\n IMPORTANT: we kindly remind you that this software module is strictly tied to the use of ORION Context Broker GE thus meaning that you should have previously set up an ORION instance of yours. Please have a look at ORION GE documentation at the following link:\n <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://catalogue.fi-ware.org/enablers/publishsubscribe-context-broker-orion-context-broker\">\n  http://catalogue.fi-ware.org/enablers/publishsubscribe-context-broker-orion-context-broker\n </a>\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Requirements\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n Following software is required for EvSi to work and needs to be installed beforehand:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://catalogue.fi-ware.org/enablers/publishsubscribe-context-broker-orion-context-broker\">\n   Orion Context Broker\n  </a>\n  \u2014 Events being published on Orion should be stored using EvSi\n </li>\n <li>\n  <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://nodejs.org/\">\n   Node.js\n  </a>\n  \u2014 JavaScript framework to run code on service side\n </li>\n <li>\n  <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">\n   NPM\n  </a>\n  \u2014 Node Package Manager handels Node.JS modules\n </li>\n <li>\n  <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.mongodb.org/\">\n   MongoDB\n  </a>\n  \u2014 NoSQL document-oriented database\n </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3>\n Installation\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n Installation of EvSi is straightforward, after all required software (listed above) is installed:\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n <li>\n  Check out the repository from GitHub (repo linked in \u00abDownloads\u00bb)\n </li>\n <li>\n  Navigate to the folder where you checked out the repo, and run \u00abnpm install\u00bb. This downloads Mongoose, a NPM module to connect to MongoDB.\n </li>\n <li>\n  Open \u00abconfig.json\u00bb and configure everything for your environment:\n  <ul>\n   <li>\n    server/port: The port you want to listen to (required later)\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    mongo/url: The URL where your MongoDB can be reached\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    info/source: String denominator used in the database schema to identify several EvSi instances\n   </li>\n  </ul>\n </li>\n <li>\n  You can now run EvSi with the command \u00abnode listen.js\u00bb from the console\n </li>\n <li>\n  Now we need to configure Orion so that informs EvSi whenever there is a new event. For that, we can easily create a JSON command which we can send via curl to our instance of Orion. An example with the FIWARE LAB global instance of Orion is given in \u00absubscribe-to-events\u00bb in the GitHub repo.\n </li>\n <li>\n  To test the setup, you can use the example in the repo in the file \u00abpush-new-event\u00bb\n </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<h3>\n Maintenance and codebase\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n Node.js (and JavaScript) code is not compiled and therefore can be adopted easily. Just alter the given functionality in \u00ablisten.js\u00bb if alternative behavior is required.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Database schema\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n Events stored in the MongoDB are structured in the following way (JSON notation):\n</p>\n\n<pre>\n{\n   eventObject: Original event processed by Orion,\n   source: Identifier of source as defined in config,\n   timestamp: time and date of storage of event in milliseconds (UNIX time)\n}\n</pre>\n\n\n",

        "Overview": "\n<p>\n Main purpose of the DSE Event Sink is keeping a local copy of all the information forwarded to the FIWARE LAB cloud infrastructure. This is because of the current demand of manufacturing companies to have all data and information on premise, as they perceive cloud storage as potential security breach. EvSi therefore allows for storing the gathered information locally as well. However, for running a full-powered application it is recommended to use FIWARE's full capability in the cloud. EvSi therefore should rather be seen as an on-premise backup and logging module.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/WP3-Factory_EvSi-DSE_Overview.png\"/>\n</p>\n\n\n",
