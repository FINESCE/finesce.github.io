            "Description": "\n\n<h3>\n Basic Concepts\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n The idea is you allow the CCF to combine the components being developed based on the interfaces that these components individually implement. The CCF will do this based on its internal composition service. For example, when the CCF is running, this allows you to simply add a .dll file to a components folder and have it connect to the already running components that it can connect with.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Basic Design Principles\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n Components implementing IComponent is managed and connected by the Composition Service as appropriate.\n</p>\n\n\n",

            "Details": "\n<p>\n In order to implement a Component, one must implement the IComponent interface:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/PIC.png\"/>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The starting point for any Component is the \u201cStart\u201d method, which is called by the Composition Service when it is determined the Component should be started. The Name and Description properties are strictly for debugging purposes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n If the IComponent must allow other components to communicate with it, it can implement the IConnectableComponent interface:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/PIC2.png\"/>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Notice that the IComponentCommunication interface does not require any implementation. It is up to the user to define the methods on an interface that extends from this, that can be exposed to other IComponents.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Finally, we have an interface that allows for a components to connect to another components. This interface is called IConntingComponent&lt;TComponentCommunication&gt; and can be seen below:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/PIC3.png\"/>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n This is a generic interface of the IComponentCommunication implementation the IComponent must connect to.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n NOTE: The NGSI9-producer component that comes with the CCF already implements the IConnectableComponent interface.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The Composition Service will manage all registered IComponent implementations and connect them as appropriate.\n</p>\n\n\n",
