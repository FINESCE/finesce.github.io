            "Description": "\n\n<h3>\n Basic Concepts\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n The Protocol Adapter Sensor2AMI gets a list of Landis+Gyr E350 DLMS/COSEM compatible energy meters from a configuration file, specifying communication related issues (TCP/IP address/hostname, TCP port, authentication type), performs cyclic reading sessions (continuous or timer-driven) collecting energy OBIS and computes power and energy values on two different integration intervals. At the end of each integration interval a ETSI M2M datagram is posted to the preconfgured EDAS instance.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Basic Design Principles\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n Sensor2AMI is a console program for MS Windows platforms, requiring .NET 4.0 or greater framework. The communication protocol to DLMS/COSEM devices is implemented through the Gurux Open Source components stack (\n <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.gurux.fi\">\n  www.gurux.fi\n </a>\n ). The SensorML communication is implemented by the IDAS FI-WARE Generic Enabler.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n DSE Interwork\n</h3>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/Sensor2AMIDSE.png\" style=\"width:1000px;\" class=img-responsive />\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Figure 1: Energy marketplace architecture (focused on Sensor2AMI DSE)\n </strong>\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/Sensor2AMIDSE_SubModules2.png\" class=img-responsive />\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Figure 2: Sensor2AMI sub-modules\n </strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n IAM-Reader is an implementation of a client data provider designated to collect real time metering data from energy meters featuring the DLMS/COSEM protocol.\n <br/>\n IAM-Reader collects metering information from energy meters, by reading the proper data objects (energy registers, power profiles) and processing them in order to obtain the data packet with load samples and metering data to be posted to IAM-Server Relay.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n IAM-Server Relay is an implementation of a middleware server receiving data from IAM data providers (for instance IAM-Reader) and preparing for posting to IAM2IDAS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The IAM2IDAS module converts DLMS objects into a number of data packets formatted according to IDAS-compliant standards and then performs the call(s) to IDAS GE.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n GE Dependancies\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n The implementation of this DSE is working with the public instance of IDAS available at the following URL (\n <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://eidas4.lab.fi-ware.org:5371\">\n  http://eidas4.lab.fi-ware.org:5371\n </a>\n ). The public instance of IDAS has been \"ad-hoc\" configured (by the IDAS team) to deliver SENSOR2AMI measurements to the WP4 instance of ORION (v0.14).\n</p>\n\n\n",

        "Usage": "\n\n<h3>\n Installation\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n This software is hardware- (meter-) dependent. Please refer to the Landis+Gyr documentation about the E350 meters and ZXF modules first.\n <br/>\n This software is FINESCE application dependant. Pelase refer to the FIENSCE documentation first.\n <br/>\n This software contains the DLMS/COSEM implementation. Please refer to the GURUX documentation first.\n <br/>\n This software communicates with the IDAS and ORION FIWARE components. Please refer to the FIWARE documentation first.\n <br/>\n This software uses SensorML to communicate with the IDAS. Please refer to the OpenGIS/IoT documentation first.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n When all external dependencies are solved, you might begin the installation. To install it in your system, do create the folders IAMReader, IAMServer, IAM2IDAS, GURUX and expand/copy the software contained in the compressed archive. Please do ensure that the FINESCE services are running. Please configure real IP addresses of them in the configuration files. If (when) all the external components are available and running, you may try to run the \"MTServer\" first, and the \"IAMReader\" then.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Recompiling\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n This bundle comes as \"open source\". It was engineered by using the Microsoft Visual Studio version 2010. You may reopen it in the compatible \"Visual Studio\" version. Please create your own new project and feel free to use the sources to derive your new software (dont forget that your modified software will remain subject of the lGPL v2 license).\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Running\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n Do run MTServer first.\n <br/>\n Do run the IAMReader then; please read first about the arguments by launching \"IAMReader.exe /h\"\n <br/>\n IAMReader arguments\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Type IAMReader.exe /h to display the program usage arguments:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n /a= Authentication (None (default), Low, High). /host= host name. /l Loop time (-1: single run (default), 0: continuous, 1: 1 minute, 2: 2 minutes, etc...) /m= manufacturer identifier (see GURUX documentation at\n <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/gurux\">\n  gurux\n </a>\n ) /p= port number or name (default: 4059). /pw= Password for authentication. /s= start protocol (IEC or DLMS). /sm= SitesMap file (site parameters in the sitemap file override the command line arguments) /sp= serial port. /is= IAM server. /t Trace messages. Example: Read LG device using TCP/IP connection: IAMReader /m=lgz /host=192.168.200.20 /p=4059 Read LG device using serial port connection: IAMReader /m=lgz /sp=COM1 /s=DLMS\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Refer to GURUX documentation for details about the meaning and values of each DLMS specific parameters.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Configuring the SiteMap file\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n The IAMReader program gets from a xml-formatted configuration file (default: Sitesmap.xml) all the information needed to communicate with DLMS meters installed into the field. An example of this file is included in the compressed archive. The file \"Sitesmap.xml\" stays in the same directory of teh IAMReader.exe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n For each meter to connect, a specific section into the sitemap file needs to be configured.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The structure of section looks like the following (note that the section is managed directly by the program, so do not edit it): Put here the meter site name (mandatory) Put here a description of site (may be empty) true to enable the data reading, false to disable Put here the IP address of the meter (ex. 192.168.200.2) 4059 Put here the authentication type (None, Low, High) 1.0.16.7.0.255 1.0.1.8.0.255 1.0.2.8.0.255 1.0.3.8.0.255 1.0.4.8.0.255 1.0.99.1.0.255\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Stopping\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n Do terminate the IAMReader first\n <br/>\n Do terminate the MTServer then.\n <br/>\n Aborting\n</p>\n\n<p>\n If one of the modules terminates abnormally, you have to terminate the remaining instances. If the external FINESCE services terminate abnormally, it could be useful to terminate all the running instances and to launch newly the clean instances then.\n</p>\n\n\n",

        "Overview": "\n<p>\n This package contains the FINESCE DSE (developed in the context of the FINESCE WP4) deputed to manage the Landis+Gyr E350 neters.\n <br/>\n In order to operate, it requires the GURUX DLMS/COSEM libraries, which are lGPL v2. You should download them and install by your own.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n This FINESCE DSE is represented by two executble files, the IAMReader.exe and the MTServer.exe, and the IAM2IDAS dynamic library. They are designed to take part of the FINESCE distributed architecture. This bundle contains the compiled EXE files that can run immediately, but they require some other FINESCED modules being already in execution prior to the launch. These modules cannot run at their own because they take part of the distributed FINESCE (domain) application. This bundle comunicates with the FINESCE instance of IDAS and ORION, which should be already running when you launch the binaries.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n This bundle is released as open source lGPL v2, so it contains the source statements in order to be re-compiled and built. Add the reference to the above mentioned Gurux assemblies into the FINESCE DSE project, specifying the folder where they are located.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n What you get\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n The Protocol Adapter Sensor2AMI is an implementation of a solution for reading Landis+Gyr E350 DLMS/COSEM compatible electric energy meters and publishing application-specific power and energy profiles to Device Backend Management IDAS GE into the FIWARE architecture.\n <br/>\n It self gathers metering data from a locally configured network of a/m energy meters, computes load and energy profiles according two independent integration periods and posts those data to an instance of IDAS GE according to ETSI M2M (SensorML 1.0) specifications.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Why to get it\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n Should you look for the DLMS/COSEM compliant implementation of the Automated Meter Reading (AMR) and the ETSI M2M interoperability with the Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMI), this Sensor2AMI Protocol Adapter is the exact answer because\n <br/>\n - You could use this DSE to interface Landis+Gyr E350 DLMS/COSEM compatible energy meters to IDAS GE, encapsulating the meter reading protocol complexity.\n <br/>\n - You could use this DSE when the compatibility with the DLMS/COSEM and SensorML is required.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Open Specifications\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.dlms.com/index2.php\">\n  DLMS: \u201cDevice Language Message specification\u201d - a generalised concept for abstract modelling of communication entities\n </a>\n <br/>\n <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.dlms.com/index2.php\">\n  COSEM: \u201cCOmpanion Specification for Energy Metering\u201d - sets the rules, based on existing standards, for data exchange with energy meters\n </a>\n <br/>\n <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://forge.fiware.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fiware/index.php/ETSI_M2M_Architecture_Overview\">\n  ETSI M2M Architecture Overview\n </a>\n <br/>\n <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://docbox.etsi.org/smartM2M/\">\n  ETSI M2M Specifications rel. 1\n </a>\n</p>\n\n\n",
