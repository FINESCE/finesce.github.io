            "Description": "\n\n<h3>\n Basic Concepts\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n The Protocol Adapter Sensor2AMI gets a list of Landis+Gyr E350 DLMS/COSEM compatible energy meters from a configuration file, specifying communication related issues (TCP/IP address/hostname, TCP port, authentication type), performs cyclic reading sessions (continuous or timer-driven) collecting energy OBIS and computes power and energy values on two different integration intervals. At the end of each integration interval a ETSI M2M datagram is posted to the preconfgured EDAS instance.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Basic Design Principles\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n Sensor2AMI is a console program for MS Windows platforms, requiring .NET 4.0 or greater framework. The communication protocol to DLMS/COSEM devices is implemented through the Gurux Open Source components stack (\n <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.gurux.fi\">\n  www.gurux.fi\n </a>\n ). The SensorML communication is implemented by the IDAS FI-WARE Generic Enabler.\n</p>\n\n\n",
