            "Description": "\n\n<h3>\n Basic Concepts\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n <strong>\n  Cosmos2Scilab\n </strong>\n is a Java Timer service that provides SCILAB module weather forecast and load profile data in two different .csv files. Every fifteen minutes it retrieves weather forecast and load profile data by two REST services  and then writes/updates the values into two files that have a specific format acknowledged by the SCILAB module. Weather.csv file contains a list of weather attributes such as values of temperature, cloud cover and wind speed related to both the current weather condition and the situation in the next 1 to 24 hours. Loadprofile.csv file contains the load attributes for each monitored meter installed at Terni trial site. Both files are essential for SCILAB module to perform its analysis.\n <br/>\n This component can be eventually re-used and customized to fulfill the general need of having a piece of software which writes data onto .csv files.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The\n <strong>\n  INP-SCILAB\n </strong>\n module is a scilab code which main inputs are produced by Cosmos2Scilab module and its main outputs are two .csv files that are read by Silab2Orion module. INP-SCILAB module has two main tasks: 1/ Read the load profile data file, which contains the measures acquired by smart meters. The module verifies the measurements, completes unknown data and runs an unbalanced load flow in order to compute load losses at power-lines and voltage drops. 2/ Read the weather forecast and using the LibSVM toolbox for scilab, performs a short-term prediction of consumed and produced power by all customers. Finally, the INP-SCILAB writes two .csv files: a first one including voltage drops values for current state of the network and the predicted values. The second file includes the predicted power consumption and generation by every customer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <strong>\n  Scilab2Orion\n </strong>\n is a Java Timer service which reads data from two .csv file produced by Scilab and then writes/updates as many ORION Context Broker GE entities as the rows of these .csv files. The attributes of the first entity (entityName = \"PowLosVotDrop\" ) contains values of Power Losses/Voltage Drops for each Line of the trial grid. The attributes of the second one (entityName = \"LoadPrediction\" ) contains values of DownstreamActivePower, Upstream_ActivePower  and ReactivePower prediction for the next 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours.\n <br/>\n This component can be eventually re-used and customized to fulfill the general need of having a REST service which is connected to the ORION GE.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n Basic Design Principles\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n Figure 1 shows the Cosmos2Scilab domain model. It consists of a Timer class \u201cCosmos2ScilabTimer\u201d that schedules a TimerTask class \u201cCosmos2Scilab\u201d and two classes \u201cWeatherForecast\u201d and \u201cLoad\u201d (java bean)  that respectively represent the attributes of a weather forecast and the Load profile.\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/Cosmos2Scilab_Domain_Model.png\" class=img-responsive />\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Figure 1: Cosmos2Scilab domain model\n </strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Figure 2 shows the Scilab domain model. It consists of four blocks. \u2018simulator_INP.sce\u2019 is the main function that reads the input files every 15 minutes, organize the data and calls the \u2018loadFlow_INP.sce\u2019 and \u2018predictor_INP.sce\u2019 functions. \u2018loadFlow_INP.sce\u2019 runs an unbalanced load flow and computes the load losses and voltage drops on every line. \u2018predictor_INP\u2019 runs every hour and predicts the consumption/production of every installed meter using the libSVM library and a matrix of pre-defined parameters. \u2018customerData.sce\u2019 includes the physical parameters of the trial grid, including bus-bars, power lines characteristics, customers IDs and power-base values.\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/Scilab_Domain_Model.png\" style=\"width:400px;\" class=img-responsive />\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Figure 2: INP-Scilab domain model\n </strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Figure 3 shows the Scilab2Orion domain model. It consists of a Timer class \u201cScilab2OrionTimer\u201d that schedules a TimerTask class \u201cScilab2Orion\u201d and two classes \u201cPredictionContextElement\u201d and \u201cPowerVoltaveContextElement\u201d (ContextElement)  that respectively represent the attributes of a Prediction and a measure of PowerLosses and VoltageDrops.\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/Scilab2Orion_Domain_Model.png\" class=img-responsive />\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Figure 3: Scilab2Orion domain model\n </strong>\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n DSE Interwork\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n This DSE does not interact with any other WP4 DSE.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n GE Dependancies\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n The implementation of this DSE (in particular the Scilab2ORION module) is working with an instance of ORION v0.14.\n</p>\n\n\n",

Scilab is available for download free of charge under Mac OSx, Windows and GNU/Linux.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n It is\n <ins>\n  necessary\n </ins>\n to install Scilab in order to run the codes ('.sce' files) that are part of the INP-SCILAB block. Scilab binaries can be downloaded directly from the Scilab homepage\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.scilab.org\">\n  www.scilab.org\n </a>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n or from the Download area\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.scilab.org/download\">\n  download\n </a>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n It is strongly recommended to follow the installing recommendations published by Scilab Consortium\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.scilab.org/en/content/download/247/1702/file/introscilab.pdf\">\n  introscilab.pdf\n </a>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n After download and install Scilab, open the folder containing Scilab-5.5.1 and launch from the command line in Linux by using the following:\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>./bin/scilab -nw</code></pre>\n\n<p>\n If you are using Windows or MacOSx, you can double-click on the Scilab-5.5.1 icon.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n It is\n <ins>\n  mandatory\n </ins>\n to install a library that includes SVM tools and large-scale linear classification in order to use the INP-SCILAB module. The toolbox is called \u201clibsvm and liblinear 1.4.1.1-1\u201d, to install it write on Scilab environment:\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>--&gt; atomsInstall('libsvm')</code></pre>\n\n<p>\n Once installed, restart Scilab application and you are ready to compile the .sce codes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n For more information about SVM library, please, refer to:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://atoms.scilab.org/toolboxes/libsvm\">\n  libsvm\n </a>\n</p>\n\n\n\nINP-SCILAB module is composed of five codes .sce:\n\t<ol>\n <li>\n  'simulator_INP.sce' - Simulator manager and time processing\n </li>\n <li>\n  'customerData.sce' - This file contains the system data\n </li>\n <li>\n  'launch_INPSCILAB.sce' - Main file to launch the INP-SCILAB module\n </li>\n <li>\n  'loadFlow_INP.sce' - Unbalanced Load Flow\n </li>\n <li>\n  'predictor_INP.sce' - SVM predictor\n </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\nAs well, it uses several '.csv' files for prediction support:\n\t<ol>\n <li>\n  'history_INP.csv' - Hourly historical consumptions/generation of users\n </li>\n <li>\n  'onlineHistory.csv' - File that is created by the module itself to store last 1-month data\n </li>\n <li>\n  'loadData_Profil.csv' - Quarterly historical consumtion/generation of users\n </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\n A sample of 'history_INP.csv' and 'loadData_Profile.csv' files are shared.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n And a '.sce' file that contains the filepaths:\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n <li>\n  'simulator_properties.sce'\n </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\n Please, before launching the simulator, modify this file in order to select the read/write paths.\n</p>\n\n<pre>\nsimulator_filepath=(path to read SCILAB-INP codes)\ninput_filepath=(path to read load file)\noutput_filepath=(path to write results files)\n</pre>\n\n\n<h4>\n 'simulator_INP.sce\u2019\n</h4>\n\n<p>\n 'simulator_INP' is the main function of the module. It controls the load flow and predictor algorithm, manipulates data and reads/writes .csv files.\n</p>\n\n\n<h4>\n \u2018customerData.sce\u2019\n</h4>\n\n<p>\n 'customerData.sce' contains the main information about the topology of the trial grid. Update this file with the characteristics of your grid. The main variables to set are:\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/customerDataTable.png\" style=\"width:600px;\" class=img-responsive />\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Table 1: Trial Grid topology characteristics\n </strong>\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/d_DataTable.png\" style=\"width:400px;\" class=img-responsive />\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Table 2: Line Data Format (d)\n </strong>\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/po_DataTable.png\" style=\"width:400px;\" class=img-responsive />\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Table 3: PQ Load Data Format (po)\n </strong>\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/codes_DataTable.png\" style=\"width:400px;\" class=img-responsive />\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Table 4: Customer codes Data Format (codes)\n </strong>\n</p>\n\n\n<h4>\n \u2018predictor_INP.sce\u2019\n</h4>\n\n<p>\n 'predictor_INP.sce' contains the algorithm for short-term prediction based on Support Vector Machines method. It is important to update the SVM parameters according to your data sets on the parameters_svm matrix. In order to identify the correct parameters you can use the WEKA open-source software or you can use other software to perform a grid search algorithm. For more information about WEKA and forecasting models, please refer to:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://wiki.pentaho.com/display/DATAMINING/Time+Series+Analysis+and+Forecasting+with+Weka\">\n  Time+Series+Analysis+and+Forecasting+with+Weka\n </a>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The example case uses the epsilon_SVR regression type and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) for the Kernel Function. For that reason the parameters c (cost), g (gamma) and p (epsilon) are used. However, each data set has a different set of parameters. Therefore, you have to validate your data sets and parameters by training your model and applying a convenient accuracy measure. \u2018predictor_INP.sce\u2019 includes three accuracy measures: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n As well, the example case uses 1h time-stamped historic data sets to train and update every hour the predictor model. These data sets have to be included in the input file 'history_INP.csv' and are read by the 'predictor_INP.sce'. 'history_INP.csv' have the following format:\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/history_DataTable.png\" style=\"width:400px;\" class=img-responsive />\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Table 5: 'history_INP.csv' Data Format\n </strong>\n</p>\n\n\n<h4>\n \u2018loadFlow_INP.sce\u2019\n</h4>\n\n<p>\n \u2018loadFlow_INP.sce\u2019 contains the algorithm to compute the load losses and voltage drops. The algorithm is based on the papers:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n \u201cA Direct approach for distribution system load flow solutions,\u201d Jen-Hao Teng, IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery,  vol. 18, no. 3, July 2003.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n \u201cPower Flow in four-wire distribution networks \u2013 General Approach,\u201d Rade Ciric, Antonio Padilha and Luis Ochoa, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, vol. 18, no. 4, November 2003.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Please, be aware that input data is in [p.u.] units and output data is in [V], [A] and [W] units.\n</p>\n\n\n<h4>\n \u2018launch_INPSCILAB.sce\u2019\n</h4>\n\n<p>\n 'launch_INPSCILAB.sce' launches automatically the INP-SCILAB module. After the first simulation is done, verify that the OUTPUT folder has two files: 'prediction.csv' and 'powerLosses_VoltageDrops.csv'.\n <br/>\n In order to launch the simulation write on Scilab the following:\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>--&gt;exec('launch_INPSCILAB.sce',-1)</code></pre>\n\n<pre><code>--&gt;launch_INPSCILAB()</code></pre>\n\n<p>\n If you have an error message with:\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>File \"launch_INPSCILAB.sce\" does not exist.</code></pre>\n\n<p>\n Verify that you have set correctly the path way directory. You can get current Scilab directory writing the following:\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>--&gt;pwd</code></pre>\n\n<p>\n If you want to modify the current directory write:\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>--&gt;chdir('_mydirectoryname_')</code></pre>\n\n\n<h3>\n SCILAB2ORION (Java TIMER client)\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n IMPORTANT: we kindly remind you that this software module is strictly tight to the use of ORION Context Broker GE thus meaning that you should have previously set up an ORION instance of yours. Please have a look at ORION GE documentation at the following link\n <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://catalogue.fi-ware.org/enablers/publishsubscribe-context-broker-orion-context-broker\">\n  publishsubscribe-context-broker-orion-context-broker\n </a>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Download the artefact (in the form a .jar file) from the bottom of the page.\n <br/>\n Open the .jar file (you can use an appropriate software like \u201cwinRar\u201d or \"7zip\"); open the  \u201cscilab2orion.properties\u201d file located in the root directory and then amend the following configuration properties:\n</p>\n\n<pre>\nscilab2orion.orionServerUrl = http://(your ORION instance URL):1026\nscilab2orion.registerContexPath = NGSI10/updateContext\n\nscilab2orion.fileInputPowerVoltage = (your file path)//powerLosses_VoltageDrops.csv\nscilab2orion.fileInputPredictions  = (your file path)/predictions.csv\n</pre>\n\n<p>\n Save the changes to the .properties file and deploy the .jar file on a server with a jre installed. We recommend you to use an updated version of Java JRE (e.g. 1.6 / 1.7); we have used a JDK 1.6.xx. The\n <strong>\n  scilab2orion\n </strong>\n module contains a java timer class that has to be launched from the command line by using the following:\n</p>\n\n<pre>\njava -jar scilab2orion-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\n</pre>\n\n<p>\n To verify that the deploy of the scilab2orion application has been done successfully and that it consequently runs, you have to access ORION to verify that new \u201cPowLosAndVoltDrops\u201d entities have been saved; in particular one entity for each line of the following type should be created (or updated in case it already exists) in the NoSQL DB underlying ORION (i.e. MongoDB):\n</p>\n\n<pre>\n{\n  \"_id\" : {\n    \"id\" : \"line1\",\n    \"type\" : \"PowLosAndVoltDrops\" \n  },\n  \"attrs\" : [{\n      \"name\" : \"currentTime\",\n
