This module retrieves a set of weather forecast data by the service every five minutes and then writes/updates the values in a set of attributes of a specific ORION entity (which type is \u201cWeather\u201d). The attributes list includes a series of values of temperature, cloud cover and wind speed related to both the current situation and the weather conditions in the next 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours.\n</p>\n\n<a name=\"Basic-Design-Principles\">\n</a>\n\n<h3>\n Basic Design Principles\n <a class=\"wiki-anchor\" href=\"#Basic-Design-Principles\">\n  \u00b6\n </a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n Figure 1 shows the WeaFor2Orion domain model. It consists of a Timer class \u201cWeatherTimer\u201d that schedules a TimerTask class \u201cWeaFor2Orion\u201d and two classes \u201cWeatherForecast\u201d (java bean) and \u201cWeatherContextElement\u201d (ContextElement) that respectively represent the attributes of a weather forecast and the ORION entity that will map it.\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <img alt=\"\" src=\"images/redmine/weafor2orion_domainModel.png\" style=\"width:800px;\"/>\n <br/>\n <strong>\n  Figure 1: WeaFor2Orion domain model\n </strong>\n</p>\n\n<a name=\"Detailed-Specifications\">\n</a>\n\n",

Please have a look at ORION GE documentation at the following link\n <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://catalogue.fi-ware.org/enablers/publishsubscribe-context-broker-orion-context-broker\">\n  http://catalogue.fi-ware.org/enablers/publishsubscribe-context-broker-orion-context-broker\n </a>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Download the artefact (in the form a .war file) from the bottom of the page.\n <br/>\n Open the .war file (you can use an appropriate software like \u201cwinRar\u201d or \"7zip\"); open the  \u201cweafor2orionrest.properties\u201ds file located in the following directory:  WEB-INF/classes/ and then amend the following configuration properties:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n weafor2orionrest.orionServerUrl =\n <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://(your\">\n  http://(your\n </a>\n ORION instance URL):1026\n <br/>\n weafor2orionrest.registerContexPath = NGSI10/updateContext\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Save the changes to the .properties file and deploy the .war file on a Tomcat application server  using the \u201cTomcat Web Application Manager\u201d (see attached screenshot). We recommend you to use an updated version of Tomcat; we have used Apache Tomcat 7.xx.\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <img alt=\"\"

that the deploy of the weafor2orion REST application was done successfully and that it consequently runs, you have to type the following URL in a common browser like Google Chrome or Microsoft Internet Explorer: \n\t<ul>\n <li>\n  <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://(your\">\n   http://(your\n  </a>\n  tomcat ip)/weafor2orionrest/rest/sendWeatherData\n </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n and you should
